# Scarf

**The native Mac & iOS app for the [Hermes AI agent](https://github.com/hermes-ai/hermes-agent).** Full visibility into what Hermes is doing, when, and what it creates — on your Mac against one local install or many remote ones, and from your iPhone over SSH with **ScarfGo**.

**Latest release:** [v2.21.0](https://github.com/awizemann/scarf/releases/tag/v2.21.0) — Hermes v0.20.5 parity: the Health view survives v0.20.5's removal of the `hermes version` subcommand (which would otherwise burn a chat-agent turn on every Health load), the Profiles list handles the new `Display Name (id)` rendering, and v0.20.5 hosts gain the zero-auth **OpenCode Free** provider (keyless providers no longer ask for an API key), an **Unlimited** max-turns setting matching the new upstream default, and an **Auto (unset)** STT provider option. Previous: [v2.20.0](https://github.com/awizemann/scarf/releases/tag/v2.20.0) brought Hermes v0.20.4 parity, session-list upgrades, curator ledger & purge, project skills, the MCP catalog picker, and anonymous opt-out usage analytics on macOS ([Privacy Policy](Privacy-Policy); iOS sends nothing). All earlier versions: [Release Notes Index](Release-Notes-Index).

**Mobile:** [Join the ScarfGo public TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/qCrRpcTz) — see [ScarfGo](ScarfGo) for the feature tour and [ScarfGo Onboarding](ScarfGo-Onboarding) for the one-minute SSH setup.

**Targets Hermes:** v0.20.5 (v2026.8.19). Everything newer than a host's version is capability-gated or schema-detected — Hermes v0.6.0 through v0.20.4 hosts keep working exactly as before, with newer-only surfaces hidden gracefully. History: [Hermes Version Compatibility](Hermes-Version-Compatibility).

**Available in:** English, Simplified Chinese (zh-Hans), German (de), French (fr), Spanish (es), Japanese (ja), Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR). See [Localization](Localization). _ScarfGo is English-only in v1._

## What Scarf does

Scarf mirrors Hermes's surface area through a sidebar UI, with **Projects first** — selecting a project opens a unified cockpit (Dashboard, Sessions, Board, Site, Context, Cron, Memory, Secrets, Templates, Slash, Mini-apps, Fleet):

- **Projects** — cockpit, agent-generated dashboards, Kanban, mini-apps, fleet drift + apply.
- **Monitor** — Dashboard, Insights, Sessions, Activity. See what Hermes is doing.
- **Interact** — Chat (ACP rich chat + real terminal), Memory, Curator, Skills.
- **Configure** — Platforms, Personalities, Quick Commands, Credential Pools, Plugins, Webhooks, Profiles, Models, Hermes Proxy.
- **Manage** — Tools, MCP Servers, Messaging Gateway, Cron, Health, Logs, Settings.

Capability-gated sections (Kanban, Curator, Models, Proxy, and many settings) appear only when the connected host's Hermes version supports them.

Scarf 2.0+ is a multi-window app — one window per Hermes server, local or remote. Remote hosts are reached over plain SSH using your existing `~/.ssh/config`, agent, ProxyJump, and ControlMaster.

## Project status

Open-source (MIT), actively maintained. See [Roadmap](Roadmap) for what's coming.
